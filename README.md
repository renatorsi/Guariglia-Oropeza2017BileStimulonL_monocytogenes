This repository contains additional files related to the article "The bile stimulon in isolates representing the two main Listeria monocytogenes lineages is characterized by strain-specific patterns and the upregulation of motility, cell wall modification functions, and the PrfA regulon."

LM10403S_AND_H7858_GOterms.xlsx spreadsheet contains all the GO terms annotated for the loci present in 10403S and H7858 genomes.

PrfA_SigB_lists.xlsx spreadsheets contain the lists of PrfA- and SigB-dependent genes used in the article. Only genes with identified upstream SigB-dependent promoters or upstream PrfA boxes were considered. Overlap between the PrfA and SigB regulons are highlithed in red and are also shown in a separate spreadsheet tab. Results from the Bile vs. Control experiment (see article) are also included in a separate spreadhsheet tab.
